\-Grid based \-D$\ast$ \-Lite in 3\-D, extends graph-\/based \-D$\ast$ \-Lite. \-The class maps grid cell costs and the transition costs b/n two cells into graph edge costs of the base \-Search class

\-The cell transition costs are hardcoded as the euclidean distance b/n the centers of the cells (i.\-e. each cell has 26 neighbors) \-These transition costs are added to the maximum of the values of two neighboring cells to compute the cost of their connecting edge. \-Finally that cost is multiplied by the variable scale.

\-The planner is used as follows\-:

1) \-Grid\-Search3\-D(map, width, height) 2) \-Set\-Start(x, y) 3) \-Set\-Goal(x, y) 4) \-Plan(path) and \-Opt\-Path(path, opt\-Path) -\/-\/ to plan a path and optimize it 5) follow path until map changes are observed 6) for each change\-: \-Set\-Cost(x, y, cost) or change the whole map\-: \-Set\-Map(map) 7) \-Set\-Start(x,y) -\/-\/ change the start to the current robot position 8) goto 4
